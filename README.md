Homework Problem:
Now that you have completed the ER/EER diagram in Group Project 1 and converted it into a
relational schema, the next step is to implement the database in MySQL. In this phase, you will
create the actual database and tables based on the relational schema you developed.
You will need to create individual CREATE TABLE scripts for each table in your team’s
database. Each script should be named as TABLENAME.sql and must be executable in MySQL.
Once completed, upload all the scripts to your team’s GitHub repository.
Your scripts and database will be graded, and we will verify that everything is implemented
correctly. Please note that this is a group submission, so only the database and GitHub
repository associated with your team will be reviewed.
It is your team's responsibility to create a repository with your teammates on GitHub and ensure
it is a public repository that can be shared with the TAs for grading. Failure to share the
repository with the TAs will result in a 0 for the assignment.
